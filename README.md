📋 ToDoListPlus 
ToDoListPlus is a Windows desktop application that integrates directly with your Microsoft account, allowing you to manage tasks in one place while keeping them in sync with your Outlook Tasks and optionally your Outlook Calendar.

With ToDoListPlus, you can:

Create tasks locally that automatically sync to your Outlook Tasks.

Optionally create calendar events for your tasks, complete with reminders.

Toggle an overlay view that stays on top of your screen, so you can always see your tasks without switching windows.

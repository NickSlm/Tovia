Tovia is a Windows desktop application that integrates directly with your Microsoft account, allowing you to manage tasks in one place while keeping them in sync with your Outlook Tasks and optionally your Outlook Calendar.

With Tovia, you can:

Create tasks locally that automatically sync to your Outlook Tasks.

Optionally create calendar events for your tasks, complete with reminders.

Toggle an overlay view that stays on top of your screen, so you can always see your tasks without switching windows.

Features:

Microsoft Account Integration – Sign in securely with your Microsoft account.

Two-way Task Sync – Automatically creates your Outlook tasks when you add a task in the app.

Calendar Event Creation – Turn any task into a calendar event with a built-in reminder.

Overlay View – A small on-screen panel showing your active tasks, which can be toggled on/off anytime.
